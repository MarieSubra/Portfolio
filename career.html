            <p><strong>Description :</strong> RTE is a French company that transmits high and very high voltage electricity throughout the country.</p>
            <p><strong>Mission :</strong> I studied the short-circuit current of equipment used to connect power lines to each other. To do this, I used AutoCAD software and an SAP product. This enabled the RTE database to be updated.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills developed :</strong> Autonomy, rigour, communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Name :</strong> Virginie</p>
            <p><strong>Profession :</strong> Engineering Program Manager</p>
            <p><strong>Why I contact her:</strong> I contacted Virginie because she studied at ENSEEIHT 20 years ago. 
            She studied computer science and applied mathematics, which corresponds to my current field of study.
            I am particularly interested in her professional background, as she has worked in various groups in the 
            IT sector, such as Météo France, CLS and Valtech. She will therefore be able to tell me about her varied
            experiences in these different fields. She currently works for an international start-up called Pigment,
            which is developing an integrated planning platform based on agentic AI. I am 
            interested in a career as a software engineer : coding my e-portfolio introduced me to web development, 
            and I would like to know what kind of work it involves.
            I would also like to learn more about what it means to work in a dynamic start-up like this.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The interview :</strong> Virginie was unavailable for the past two weeks, so we agreed to 
            conduct a remote interview during the week of 3 November. We also plan to meet in person on 22 November 
            during the event organised by ENSEEIHT with former students.</p>

            <p><strong>Name :</strong> Enzo</p>
            <p><strong>Profession :</strong> IT/Electronics Validation Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space </p>
            <p><strong>Why I contact him:</strong> I contacted Enzo because I am interested in the aeronautics and 
            aerospace sector. Toulouse is world-renowned in this field, and I would like him to tell me about his 
            work as an engineer in his company, as well as other jobs that exist in this sector. I particularly 
            liked his profile description on My Job Glasses and wanted to find out more: he designs tests for 
            electronic cards and equipment. This is a technical aspect that really intrigues me because it requires 
            skills in IT and electronics, a specialisation that I am particularly interested in.  </p>
            <p><strong>The interview :</strong> We had agreed on a remote interview for the week of 27 November, but it 
            could not take place due to his schedule. We will therefore agree on a date at a later stage.</p>
