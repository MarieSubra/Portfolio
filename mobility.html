    <h1>International Mobility</h1>
    <p class = "intro">
      During our engineering degree programme, we are required to spend a semester abroad immersed in the country 
      of our choice. We have the option of doing an internship or taking courses at a university and earning credits.

        <h3>Taiwan</h3>
        <p>
          National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taiwan is my first wish for my exchange program. The university offers many 
          courses in its Computer Science & Information Engineering (CSIE) department, particularly in software 
          engineering, a field that interests me greatly. The specialities Advanced Software Technology, 
          Development of App Program for Mobile Device and Software Engineering. 
          Taiwan would also be a great opportunity to improve my Chinese and English. NTU is renowned for its 
          international outlook and the diversity of its students, which will allow me to discover new cultures and progress in an enriching environment.

        <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
        <p>
          As Taiwan, Hong Kong is a particularly dynamic cultural and international center, 
          which will allow me to improve my English and Chinese skills. The city is home to many multinational 
          companies and start-ups, particularly in the engineering sector and computer sciences. I am currently in contact with an 
          engineer working at BNP Paribas, who could help me identify internship opportunities as part of my 
          mobility program.

        <p>
          The University of Sydney offers several courses open to international students in the fields of 
          engineering and computer science. The specialty that interests me most is software engineering because 
          it covers topics that interest me, such as language compilers, software analyst and engineer, and web 
          developer. I am also interested in the advanced computing specialty because it will allow me to improve 
          my programming and design skills.
